  <p><em>My Journey to Linux: From BBS to Debian</em></p>

  <p>In the early 80's, I first encountered the nascent personal computer scene at the Meadowlands Community Center's monthly show. It quickly turned into an IBM Clone Marketplace, but I was already devoted to the Commodore ecosystem, owning a Vic20, C64, C128, A500, A2000, A2500, and two A3000 Video Toasters. My Amiga 2000's superior video capabilities made the expensive IBM clones running Windows 3.1 look primitive and slow.</p>

  <p>Despite my allegiance, I eventually acquired a Leading Edge 386 clone with a 40MB hard drive, a Sound Blaster, and an expensive graphics card. It still felt horrible compared to the Amiga, but the shift was undeniable.</p>

  <p>My focus quickly moved to running a BBS on a Commodore 64, backed by four disk drives and two dedicated phone lines. My system was cutting-edge for the time, featuring voice control using the Covox Voice digitizer, along with audio and video digitizers.</p>

  <p>The movement I found truly compelling wasn't the crippled "Public Domain" shareware, but the burgeoning Open Source concept. It was far superior, based on freedom and quality. My open-source software section quickly replaced the pirated games section on my BBS.</p>

  <p>This early passion for control, quality, and community ultimately led me to the stability of Linux. I maintain a profound trust in Debian, which remains my core operating system today.</p>
  <p>I have become a Software Architect instead of the coder.
I have done the only thing that moves us forward!</p> <p>
I learned how to get AI Studio to work for me! It wrote three systemd services for me in one week and I keep coding more apps that can be a service!  It rewrote my Flask apps to GUNICORN to get away from the development only warnings.</p> <p>
Systemd is not the same as what we used before, SURE, BUT if you take a few minutes to read thru what AI Studio or Gemini AI do, you will learn how to code it yourself!  My first hand written service worked first time due to studding what AI Studio has done!  STOP WHINING AND LEARN TO BE A Software Architect!  It's the best feeling in the world when you get it to work!
  </p>
  <p>I have no problem with age verification or the web having my info, I will upload my REAL ID when needed!  I am an open book & the more they know about me the better services I get!</p> <p>  I love targeted ads, when at my sisters house I'm forced to watch Cable TV and ads for medication and crap I'll never need drive me mad!  If they target me then I get ads for things that I am interested in.  Several focused ads inline with my Google Home Page are acceptable as long as they are  'things  that I am interested in!"</p>
 <p>My Linux Rant!
I've been using a Debian based Linux for 30 years & now use Debian 13; Zorin 18 & Mint.  I don't want 'modern", I want stable!  It needs to work after an update and Fedora has crashed on me too many times to be trusted.  </p> <p>The so called 'rolling releases' are deadly to a stable host like mine!  I have six sub-domains running using everything from Docker to Gunicorn to python3.  When a rolling release breaks, which it will, you are left with an unusable system until they fix their mess.  STABLE sometimes older apps are proven & trusted.  </p> <p>I enjoy cutting edge on my sandbox BUT NOT on my production system which my users rely on.  In a VM I am testing Debian 13 BUT will not put it into production until it is proven to be STABLE!  </p> <p>Enjoy Linux, whichever way you go! My blog explains each tool and links to the GitHub repositories, it only a start but I will add more!
</p> <p>Wayland is buggy as hell and is missing stuff, important stuff like Onboard & Barrier (which replaced Synergy) & hot keys!  Wayland does not pass my test as a working system!  It just does not WORK!  if this is the future of Linux I hope it is the far future after I am dead!   It's insane how they keep replacing stuff that works with crap that falls short of our needs!</p> <p>So called improvements are just a pain in my A**! This trend of replacing good software with crap, it has to stop!  IF they want us to use new junk they need to make sure it works and Wayland DOES NOT WORK!   </p> <p>There is way too much missing!  It is incomplete at best, just plain crap to be honest!   Like Pipe-Wire it is missing much of the functionality that we have come to love in Linux.  </p> <p>The way they keep losing features makes it more like WinBlows!  Software should not be released until it WORKS!  I miss my network audio system that no longer works!</p> <p>I still enjoy learning new tech & sharing what I learn!</p>
